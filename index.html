		<h2>My friends call me "Bro"</h2>

		<p>It's no secret that I... well, before I get to that let me explain why. Basically, why not? That's what we should all be wondering. I know it doesn't make sense right now. But there's no better time than right now. Right now is basically the future. Where will you be? More importantly, WHO will you be?</p>

		<p>CONFUSED?! Good - that's my secret. :) I like to confuse people for my own amusement. Well, mostly my friends. But now that you're here, on my page, and you're probably confused can we just update our status on facebook and make it official? Let's be friends...in a totally non-creepy way (I promise!)</p>

		<p>In all seriousness though, I know this is only an assignment and this site is not live. Here's a picture of my mom's puppy. I enjoy photography. The background photo on this page is also my work. Enjoy. </p>

		<p>Also, I'm dating this super awesome girl. She's the reason I started One Month because she's also doing it and inspired me. Plus, she's totes hot.</p>
